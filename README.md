## 👩‍💻 About Me

**Passionate Full-Stack Web Developer | Civil Engineer Turned Tech Enthusiast**

With a B.Tech in Civil Engineering, I discovered my true calling in software development, driven by an insatiable curiosity for coding and problem-solving. After completing a rigorous 35-week Full-Stack Web Development program at Masai School, I’ve mastered a diverse tech stack, including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Node.js, and MongoDB.

I’m not just a developer; I’m a lifelong learner, constantly evolving with the fast-paced world of technology. I’m eager to collaborate on innovative solutions that blend creativity and functionality, and I’m excited to bring my unique background and skillset to impactful, real-world projects.
